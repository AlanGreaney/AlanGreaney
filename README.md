### Greetings

I'm Alan, a Software Developer located in Southern California

### About Me

Formerly a musician playing the French Horn (and still Drumset), I've been programming since 2011, starting with designing and hosting customized videogame servers, expereince working in Aviation Software at Northrop Grumman, and now working at ASML via nology. Many of my hobbies intersect with programming such as video editing and arduino code (partially for model train automation), along with motorcycles and cars, movies, and still some music playing.

### My Personal Projects

- [3d Printed + Arduino Timezone Map](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/TimezoneMap)

Using 3d Printing and Arduino Code, I created a Topographical map that has multiple 4-digit 7-segment displays (Work in progress photo before building custom frame)

- [Streamdeck Video Player](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/Streamdeck-Video-Player)

Using FFMPEG and ImageMagick video/image editing libraries through NodeJS, this program converts a video into a format able to be played via the Streamdeck's API, something it was not at all designed to do even with it's LCD buttons, which made for a great challenge.
