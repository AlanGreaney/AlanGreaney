### Greetings

I'm Alan, a Software Developer located in Southern California

### About Me

Formerly a musician playing the French Horn (and still Drumset), I've been programming since 2011, starting with designing and hosting customized videogame servers, expereince working in Aviation Software at Northrop Grumman, and now working at ASML via nology. Many of my hobbies intersect with programming such as video editing and arduino code (partially for model train automation), along with motorcycles and cars, movies, and still some music playing.

### My Personal Projects

- [3d Printed + Arduino Timezone Map](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/TimezoneMap)

Using 3d Printing and Arduino Code, I created a Topographical map that has multiple 4-digit 7-segment displays (Work in progress photo before building custom frame)

- [Streamdeck Video Player](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/Streamdeck-Video-Player)

Using FFMPEG and ImageMagick video/image editing libraries through NodeJS, this program converts a video into a format able to be played via the Streamdeck's API, something it was not at all designed to do even with it's LCD buttons, which made for a great challenge. A higher quality version of this GIF is available on the specific repo

### ASML x Nology Training Course

    - Week 1 - HTML/CSS/SaSS

- [CSS Grid Area](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/nology-coursework/tree/main/CSS_HTML_Week1/css-grid-area)

Imaginary Photography site similar to the Flexbox project above, but using another method for website layout and responsiveness: CSS Grids.

    - Week 2 - Python
    
- [Main Work](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/nology-coursework/tree/main/Python_Week2/env)

Multiple small projects demonstrating understanding of the Python Language, such as Loops, Datastructures, Control Flow, Entry Points, Logging to Files/CSV, and Object Oriented Programming by means of Classes and Imports.

- [Text Adventure Projects](https://github.com/AlanGreaney/nology-coursework/tree/main/Python_Week2/env/textAdventureProject)

Utilizing all concepts listed above, we were to create a text adventure game to run within a command line window. Pushing this concept farther than the example we were to copy, I created a generalized framework for any game, which allowed for the creation and linking of scenes, theoretically allowing basically any text game to be loaded, the idea being I wanted to approach it with a way where any classmates' games could be loaded into my framework, instead of all being hardcoded.

The Main File simply loads whatever specified game is wish to be played, and follows the scene order based off the Option-Classes. A game-print function was included, that automatically converts all story text screens into the boxes surrounded by characters, so that manual sizing of the text-promopts did not have to be done manually. A method to display ASCII images within a scene was also included.
